title.

The project is named day planner that  allowed the user to create a schedule trought a daily planner. 

objective.

The purpose of this project is to allow the user to create a schedule trought a daily planner. first, the current day is showned  at the top of the calendar when the user open the planner. after, timeblocks for standard business hours will appear. for each day,  the timeblocks is color coded to illustrate  whether it is in the past, present, or future. when the user click into a timeblock , the user  can enter an event and when the user click the save button for that timeblock. the text for that event will be saved in local storage and anytime the user refresh the page, the saved events still persist.  from this project, I learned that I can use jquery code, css , Html to build a daily planner schedule. I build a daily schedule application to allowed any person to be able to enter and save any daily activity, also to see any past, present or future event.
